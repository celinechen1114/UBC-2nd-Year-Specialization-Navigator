# 2nd Year Specialization Requirement

## UBC Vancouver Campus Second Year Specialization Application Requirements for Science Students

*project proposal*:

**What will the application do?** 
- check if the student (given the first year courses he/she took) are eligible to apply to
a specific 2nd year specialization

**who will use it?**
- This program is intended for first year science students at UBC Vancouver Campus

**Why is this project of interest to you?**
- I hope this program I will design for this project will help out more first year students navigate through their 2nd 
year specialization application process.
- Me myself was going through a hard time navigating through UBC calendar to find out what courses I will need to 
complete in my first year to apply for a specialization. And when I dropped the CPSC 121 course in my
2nd Term, I was unsure if I am still eligible to apply to the CS major in May. Until I went to the Science Advising 
Office, they gave me a link to this website, https://science.ubc.ca/students/degree/apply/req, that includes
all the requirements needed to apply for each science major, and I found out that CPSC 110 is the only courses that I 
am required to complete in my first year. 
- Because this website was really useful to me, I want to make a program that 
shadows the function of checking a student's eligibility to apply for a specialization, but with an additional user 
interaction component to it and are more direct, efficient, and personal for a specific student.
