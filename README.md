# 2nd Year Specialization Requirement

## UBC Vancouver Campus Second Year Specialization Application Requirements for Science Students

*project proposal*:

**What will the application do?**
- check if the student (given the first-year courses taken) are eligible to apply to
  a specific 2nd-year specialization

**who will use it?**
- This program is intended for first-year science students at UBC Vancouver Campus

**Why is this project of interest to you?**
- I hope this program I will design for this project will help out more first-year students navigate through their 2nd
  year specialization application process.
- I was going through a hard time navigating through the UBC calendar to find out what courses I will need to
  complete in my first year to apply for a specialization. And when I dropped the CPSC 121 course in my
  2nd Term, I was unsure if I am still eligible to apply to the CS major in May. Until I went to the Science Advising
  Office, they gave me a link to this website, https://science.ubc.ca/students/degree/apply/req, that includes
  all the requirements needed to apply for each science major, and I found out that CPSC 110 is the only course that I
  am required to complete in my first year.
- Because this website was really useful to me, I want to make a program that
  shadows the function of checking a student's eligibility to apply for specialization, but with an additional user
  interaction component to it and is more direct, efficient, and personal for a specific student.

## User Stories
*PHASE ONE*
* As a user, I want to be able to add courses to my student profile
* As a user, I want to be able to pick an intended specialization and add it to my student profile
* As a user, I want to be able to change the intended specialization and update my student profile
* As a user, I want to be able to check if the courses I have added to my student profile meet the requirements
  to apply for my intended specialization

*PHASE TWO*
* As a user, I want to be able to save my student profile to file
* As a user, I want to be able to load my student profile to file

*PHASE THREE*
* include a panel in which all the courses (Xs) that have already been added to my student profile (Y) are displayed
* include a button/menu item that can add courses (Xs) to student profile
* include a button/menu item that can pick an intended specialization and add it to my student profile
* (optional) include a button/menu item that can check the user's eligibility to apply to the intended specialization
* As a user, I want to be able to load and save the state of the application
